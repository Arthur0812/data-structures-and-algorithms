These are the most common complexity classes (in order):

- O(1)                  "constant complexity"
- O(log2 log2 n)        -
- O(log2 n)             "logarithmic complexity"
- O(n)                  "linear complexity"
- O(nlog2 n)            -
- O(n^2)                "quadratic complexity"
- O(n^3)                "cubic complexity"
- O(2^n)                "exponential complexity"
