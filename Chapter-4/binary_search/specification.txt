Given an array 'a' of numbers and an integer 'x', find an integer 'i', such that
1. if there is no 'j' such that a[j] = x, 'i' is -1,
2. otherwise 'i' is 'j' for which a[j] = x.

Pseudocode:

// This assumes we are given an sorted array a of size a and a key x. 
While left is less than right,
    set mid to (left+right)/2, and
    if x is greater than a[mid],
        set left to mid+1,
    otherwise (x is less than or equal to a[mid]),
        set right to mid,
    
// Now, a[left] is the only possible item to hold the value x.
If a[left] is equal to x,
    then terminate, returning left.
Otherwise (a[left] is not x),
    then terminate, returning -1.
